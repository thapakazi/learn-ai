## Overview
This week covers the essential Python foundations needed for machine learning in DevOps and SRE contexts. Each topic is presented with real-world infrastructure and operations examples to make the concepts immediately applicable to your daily work.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this week, you will be able to:
- Write Python scripts for infrastructure automation and monitoring
- Process and analyze large-scale metrics data efficiently with NumPy
- Perform log analysis and create reports using Pandas
- Create professional monitoring dashboards and visualizations with Matplotlib
